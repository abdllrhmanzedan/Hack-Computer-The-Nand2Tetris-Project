# Hack Virtual Machine
This part of the journey aims to designing a `Virtual Machine` that able to run the the `vm` code generated by the `Jack Compiler`. this finishes the back-end of our compiler/language which consists of:
- `VMTranslator` : generates the `vm` code to run on the `Hack Virtual Machine`
- `HackAssembler`: generates the `hack` machine code to run on the `Hack Computer`
