# Hack-Computer: Nand2Tetris Project
The Nand2Tetris project involves building a computer from scratch, starting with the basic logic gate `Nand` and progressing to a complete computer with a CPU, memory, and an assembler. Additionally, it covers the development of a virtual machine, a high-level language, a compiler, and an operating system resulting in a functional computer that can run complex programmes and games `(e.g. Tetris)`.

In this repository, I’ll be documenting my progress on the journey from Nand to Tetris.

## Progress Overview
Here’s a snapshot of my progress on the journey from Nand to Tetris:

### From Nand to Hack: Hack-Computer Hardware & Architecture
1. [x] **[Elementary Logic Gates](<1 Elementary Logic Gates/README.md>):** designed basic gates like And, Or, Not, Mux, DMux, and more using HDL.
2. [x] **[Adders Family and ALU](<2 Adders Family & ALU/README.md>):** implemented the adder circuits and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), responsible for performing both arithmetic and logic operations with efficiency and precision.
3. [x] **[Memory Units](<3 Memory and Registers/README.md>):** built registers and RAM, key components for storage.
4. [x] **[Machine Language](<4 Machine Language & Assembly/README.md>):** learned and implemented programs using the Hack machine language.
5. [x] **[CPU and Architecture](<5 CPU & Computer Architecture/README.md>):** combined all components to build a functional CPU and computer architecture.

## From Hack to Tetris: Hack-Computer Software
6. [x] **[Hack-Assembler](<6 Hack Assembler/README.md>):** Building an Assembler that has the ability to convert Hack-Assembly-Language into Hack-Machine-Language that can be run on a Hack-CPU.
7. [x] **Virtual Machine(<7-8 Hack Virtual Machine/README.md>):** Design the Jack compiler back-end which is the first tier of `Jack Programming Language` compilation process.
8. [ ] **High Level Language:**
9. [ ] **Compiler:**
10. [ ] **Operating System:**
